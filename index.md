# ROBI: First Workshop on the Role of Ontologies in Biomedical AI

Ontologies and Linked Data resources are pervasive throughout the life sciences wher hundreds of ontologies are used in almost every major biological database for the formal characterization of data and the integration of knowledge. Methods that allow incorporating the knowledge in ontologies in biomedical data analysis and particular machine learning are only now being developed. The aim of the workshop is to explore the interface between domain knowledge in biomedical ontologies and machine learning from the perspective of ontologies, their structure, and underlying conceptualization. We will discuss how ontologies can contribute to build more comprehensive AI models that utilize domain knowledge, provide explanations understandable to domain experts, and identify consistency with scientific knowledge.

Topics include
* ontologies and graph embeddings
* neural reasoning with biomedical ontologies
* ontologies and Natural Language Processing
* using machine learning for ontology evaluation
