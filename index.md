# ROBI: First Workshop on the Role of Ontologies in Biomedical AI

Ontologies and Linked Data resources are pervasive throughout the life
sciences wher hundreds of ontologies are used in almost every major
biological database for the formal characterization of data and the
integration of knowledge. Methods that allow incorporating the
knowledge in ontologies in biomedical data analysis and particular
machine learning are only now being developed. The aim of the workshop
is to explore the interface between domain knowledge in biomedical
ontologies and machine learning from the perspective of ontologies,
their structure, and underlying conceptualization. We will discuss how
ontologies can contribute to build more comprehensive AI models that
utilize domain knowledge, provide explanations understandable to
domain experts, and identify consistency with scientific knowledge.
Of particular interest is how research on biomedical ontologies can be
leveraged to improve AI.

Example questions we would like to answer in the workshop are
* Does the improvement in ontology quality in the past years reflect
  their impact on machine learning methods?
* How does ontology consistency impact machine learning?
* What is missing from bio-ontologies for them to have more impact on
  AI methods?

Topics of interest include
* ontologies, graph embeddings, ontology embeddings
* neural reasoning with biomedical ontologies
* ontologies and Natural Language Processing
* machine learning in ontology evaluation
* ontologies and explainability
* biomedical ontologies in general AI
* neuro-symbolic integration in biomedicine
